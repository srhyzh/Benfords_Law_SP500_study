# Benfords_Law_SP500_study
 Applying Benford's Law to the constituents of the SP500 index

### Summary of the Notebook: "Benfordsches Gesetz_SP500 Kursver√§nderungen"

This Jupyter notebook investigates the application of Benford's Law to stock price changes of the S&P 500 companies using Python. Essential libraries used include `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib` for plotting, and `yfinance` for fetching financial data.

### Detailed Explanation

The notebook explores whether stock price changes conform to Benford's Law, which predicts the frequency distribution of the first digits in numerical data sets. The analysis is conducted on stock price data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from January 1st, 2020, to March 31st, 2022.

**Key steps in the notebook include:**
- **Data Acquisition**: Fetching stock prices for S&P 500 companies via `yfinance` and cleaning the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Data Processing**: Calculating daily percentage changes and absolute values of these changes to analyze the frequency of the first significant digits.
- **Benford Analysis**: Extracting the first significant digits from the stock changes, constructing frequency distributions, and comparing these with the expected frequencies under Benford's Law.
- **Statistical Testing**: Applying the chi-squared test to determine the goodness of fit between the observed and expected frequencies according to Benford's Law.

The notebook meticulously details each step, from data retrieval and preparation to comprehensive statistical analyses, offering insights into whether financial data such as stock price changes align with the predictions of Benford's Law. The results are visualized through histograms and bar charts, providing a clear visual representation of the conformity (or lack thereof) to Benford's Law across the S&P 500.

In conclusion, the notebook serves as a thorough examination of the peculiar patterns predicted by Benford's Law in the context of financial markets, providing valuable insights into the natural occurrence of numerical phenomena in stock price movements.
